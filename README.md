# Module Project: Redux - Car Sales

Deployed here: https://car-sales-brown.now.sh 

## Description

- Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
- Set up the Redux flow
- User should be able to add features to their car
- User should be able to remove added features from their car
- Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car

## Stretch Problems
t-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing. Have fun with this! It could end up being really cool.
- Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.
